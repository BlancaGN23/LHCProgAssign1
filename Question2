//use program to take two input arguments from terminal line
//the program expects two, should then print them out
//what happens if you put less than expected?

//Couldn't figure out how to get the code from lxplus, so I created a script that would take inputs anad print them out
//this code expects 2 arguments, since the index i is from 0-1
//if more than two arguments are entered, they are simply omitted, 
//with the first argument being the file name, and the second argument printed is the first entered 
//if the program expects more arguments that are inputed, only those entered are printed

using namespace std;
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char** argv){
//for loops to print only two arguments
//to print all arguments input, change i<1 to i<argc , so the loop continues as long as the index is less than arguments entered
  for (int i = 0; i<1; ++i)
    cout<<argv[i]<<endl;
    return 0;
    }
