//what does the header <iostream> do?
#include <iostream>

//It is a "predefined library function used for input output, containing functions of program like cout, cin, etc




//For example: the program

int main(){
cout<<"Hello World!"<<endl;
}

//would normally print out "Hello World!" to the terminal command line
//by not including the header, COUT, as well as ENDL are not recognized or "not declared in this scope"
